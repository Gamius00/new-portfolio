          <p>
            My name is Fabius, and I am an enthusiastic{" "}
            <span>{age} years old programmer</span>. Since my early childhood, I
            have been fascinated by the world of technology, and I have always
            been interested in computers and how they work. <br />
            <br /> This passion eventually led me to programming, where I can
            fully express my creativity and <span>analytical skills.</span>
            <br />
            In my free time, I am devoted to programming. <br />
            <br /> I find it incredibly exciting how just a few lines of code
            can solve complex problems. By experimenting with different
            programming languages and development environments, I have
            continuously improved my skills and I am always eager{" "}
            <span>to learn something new.</span> I enjoy finding creative
            solutions and developing programs that can help people.

            Problem-solving and crafting from scratch truly resonate with me.
            Additionally, <br />
            the strategic challenges of chess captivate me. The intricate moves
            and mental agility required make it truly rewarding.
            <br />
            <br />
            Participating in chess tournaments is a must for me, where I compete
            with fellow players, finding enrichment in every match. These
            hobbies, though distinct, align with my love for intellectual
            challenges and creative solutions. Debugging code or planning a
            chess move both offer a truly gratifying sense of accomplishment.
